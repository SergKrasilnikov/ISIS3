# ISIS3
This project was built for small pieces of advice in work with ISIS3 (Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers) for me. I hope somebody finds this advice and codes helpful in their projects.

### The main instalation guide from ISIS team:
ISIS Installation With Conda - https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3#installation

### Automatically NAC images processing and projection
In the folder "Script for LROC NAC" you can find the Bash script for the automatic processing of NAC images. Check it out!
