## ISIS3 notes
This project was built for small pieces of advice in workflow with ISIS3 (Integrated Software for Imagers and
Spectrometers) for myself. I hope somebody finds this advice and codes helpful in their projects.

### The main installation guide from the ISIS team:
[ISIS Installation With Conda](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3#installation)

### Automatically NAC images processing and projection
In the folder "Script for LROC NAC" you can find the Bash script for the automatic processing of NAC images.
This script allows you to get georeferenced NAC images in an automatic regime.
Check it out!
